# Hi there, I'm lunan0320 👋

## Federated Learning Researcher | Privacy Tech Enthusiast

As a passionate student in the field of Cybersecurity, my research is driven by a fascination with Federated Learning, the acceleration of distributed encrypted training, and fine-tuning of large language models with a strong focus on privacy-preserving techniques such as Homomorphic Encryption and Differential Privacy.

Outside the digital realm, I channel my energy into swimming and fitness.

### What I'm working on 🚀
- Improving efficiency and security in Federated Learning systems.
- Exploring advanced encryption methods for privacy in AI, including Homomorphic Encryption.
- Investigating Differential Privacy applications in fine-tuning large language models.

### Tech Stack 🛠️
- Python, PyTorch, C++, Java, C
- Homomorphic Encryption Libraries
- Differential Privacy Frameworks
- CUDA & Parallel Computing Platforms
